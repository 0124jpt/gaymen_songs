The sound of this track is a rollercoaster of tranquil and melodic arpeggios leading into explosive riffs and horn sections. The ending of the track is an almost prog-rock-esque rumble followed by tension soothing blaring horns and percussion performed by Morgan Simpson, Kaidi Akinnibi, and Joe Bristow.<br><br>The band featured this track surprisingly on a live setlist with KEXP in April 2021 and has been in high demand by the fans since its appearance.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><size=18><br><br><br><br><b>- 899.5th Chart -
